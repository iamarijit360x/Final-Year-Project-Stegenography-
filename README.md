## Region Based Robust Data Hiding Techniquewith the Application of Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Steganography project developed in 2021. The project was completed as part of the final year curriculum in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at St. Thomasâ€™ College of Engineering and Technology.

## Project Overview

- Developed a comprehensive steganography solution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for realistic cover image creation.
- Collaborated with team members Archisman Roy (handled the GAN part) and Rachana Sengupta (handled the skin detection part).
- Implemented RGB, HSV, and YCbCr skin detection algorithms for identifying message embedding regions.
- Applied a bucketing algorithm to embed messages in skin pixels with minimal impact on image integrity.
- Successfully concealed messages within GAN-generated fake images, enhancing overall security.
- Demonstrated effective synthesis of theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
- Completed the project within the given timeframe, showcasing strong project and time management skills.
